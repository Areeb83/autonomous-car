This Autonomous-Vehicle-Project is a sophisticated Arduino-based robotics system designed for intelligent navigation through a blend of sensor fusion and advanced control theory. By integrating ultrasonic sensors, infrared arrays, and Huskylens vision, the vehicle masters complex tasks like obstacle avoidance and line following. The brain of the machine utilizes PID controllers and a self-organizing algorithm to ensure precise motor performance and adaptive behavior, while wheel encoders provide real-time speed tracking for closed-loop stability.

The project features a dual-platform architecture, pairing the Arduino's hardware logic with a custom Processing-based GUI for remote interaction. This interface allows users to monitor telemetry, adjust speed limits, and control movement over a WiFi network. Beyond core navigation, the system incorporates an LED matrix for visual feedback and a server-client communication model, enabling the vehicle to act as an IoT node that can be managed from any computer on the same network.

To finalize your setup, ensure all libraries like HUSKYLENS and ControlP5 are installed in your respective IDEs. After configuring your WiFi credentials and IP addresses in the code, you can use the terminal steps we discussed earlier to push this entire structure to your GitHub repository. This will create a professional, well-documented home for your engineering work that correctly attributes the code to your personal identity.
